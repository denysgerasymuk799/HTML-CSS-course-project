                    <p>
                        SpaceX was born in 2002, when its founder, billionaire Elon Musk, took the first steps
                        in his grand ambition to send a mission to Mars.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Today, the company is way beyond the space startup stage.
                        The Hawthorne, California-based company regularly reuses rockets, sends cargo missions
                        to the International Space Station with its Dragon spacecraft and will fly astronauts
                        for NASA and others, too. SpaceX has also launched the massive Falcon Heavy and has plans
                        for an even larger rocket to reach the moon, Mars and beyond:
                        the Starship and its Super Heavy booster.

                    <p>
                        The Falcon 1 was the first rocket manufactured by SpaceX. It had a proposed capacity
                        to carry 670 kilograms (1,480 lbs.) to low Earth orbit, and it flew between 2006 and 2009.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After three launch failures, Falcon 1 sent a dummy payload to space on Sept. 29, 2008.
                        Its fifth and final launch, on July 14, 2009, sent RazakSAT, a Malaysian Earth-observation
                        satellite, into orbit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Falcon 1 rockets launched from Omelek Island, part of the Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific Ocean.
                        The 68 feet tall (21 meters) rocket was powered by a single engine (hence the "1" in its name)
                        and ran on liquid oxygen and rocket-grade kerosene.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And in case you're wondering, Musk named the Falcon rockets after the Millennium Falcon
                        ship from "Star Wars"

                        <p>
                            SpaceX soon received interest from several companies looking for a heavier-lift rocket.
                            The company had considered developing an intermediary rocket called the Falcon 5,
                            but instead skipped ahead and began work on the Falcon 9 (because its first stage used
                            a cluster of nine engines.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This rocket can send a payload to low Earth orbit weighing up to 28,991 lbs. (13,150 kg).
                            It is a two-stage rocket that at stands 230 feet (70 meters) tall and is 12 feet (3.7 m) wide.
                            SpaceX first advertised plans for the Falcon 9 in 2005 and sent the debut Falcon 9 aloft on June 7,
                            2010, from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Early customers of the rocket included Bigelow Aerospace; Avanti Communications;
                            and MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates.

                        <h2>Falcon Heavy's maiden flight</h2>
                        <p>
                            SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket, a heavy-lift version of the Falcon series, made its
                            successful debut flight on Feb. 6, 2018, launching from NASA's Pad 39A at the Kennedy
                            Space Center in Florida.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Falcon Heavy is currently the most powerful rocket in use today. It consists of three
                            first-stage core boosters based on SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket and
                            a powerful upper stage.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The rocket successfully launched a Tesla car into space and a spacesuit clad mannequin
                            called Starman on its first flight. (Musk is also the CEO of Tesla Motors.)
                            The Falcon Heavy is 230 feet tall (70 m) and can lift nearly 141,000 lbs. (64 metric tons)
                            of payload to low Earth orbit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is twice what its closest competitor, the United Launch Alliance's Delta IV Heavy,
                            can hoist into orbit.
                        </p>

                </div>

                        <h2>Falcon Heavy's rocket landing ballet</h2>

                            This picture shows Falcon Heavy's twin side boosters landing successfully
                            after the rocket's maiden flight, on Feb. 6, 2018.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While the booster stages touched down safely at Landing Zones 1 and 2 at Cape Canaveral
                            Air Force Station, near the Kennedy Space Center, the rocket's core stage hit
                            the ocean at high speed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The rocket stage carrying the Tesla car underwent one last burn to send the car toward
                            the orbit of Mars. However, as Space.com sister site Live Science reported,
                            radiation could destroy the car within a year.

                    <h1>Starship and Super Heavy</h1>
                    <p>
                        In September 2019, SpaceX founder Elon Musk announced a completely new vehicle for his company:
                        a fully reusable, massive rocket and booster designed to eventually launch people to Mars.
                        And so, the Starship and Super Heavy  were born.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Originally called the Interplanetary Transport System, and later Big Falcon Rocket,
                        the futuristic system intended for Mars exploration, but could be applied to the moon,
                        other deep-space destinations and point-point trips around Earth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each rocket will carry about 100 people, and the rocket will be fully reusable. Musk said
                        he plans to use this rocket in fleets, bringing hundreds or thousands of passengers
                        at a time to Mars. In the 2020s, Musk plans to halt all Falcon lines except for Super Heavy,
                        which would perform all sorts of missions. Destinations would range from Mars to
                        the International Space Station to orbits that would launch satellites near Earth.

                        <p>
                            SpaceX's first Crew Dragon to carry astronauts is scheduled to launch May 27.
                            That mission will launch NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International
                            Space Station on a mission that will last up to four months.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The test flight, called Demo-2, follows a series of other tests. In March 2019,
                            SpaceX flew an unpiloted Crew Dragon test flight to the station under its Demo-1 mission.
                            In January 2020, the company launched an In-Flight Abort test that demonstrated
                            the Crew Dragon's emergency escape system for launch emergencies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The company has also tested parachutes and other vital systems for Crew Dragon.

                <p>
                    We believe that in order to preserve Earth, our home,
                    for our grandchildren’s grandchildren, we must go to space to tap
                    its unlimited resources and energy. Like the Industrial Revolution gave way to trade,
                    economic abundance, new communities and high-speed transportation - our road to space opens
                    to the door to the infinite and yet unimaginable future generations might enjoy.
                    Paving the way starts now.
